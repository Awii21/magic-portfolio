## Overview

**Cruisly** is a modern web application designed to make browsing, comparing, and booking cruises easier than ever. Built with **Next.js**, it integrates the **Widgety API** to deliver up-to-date cruise information, itineraries, ship details, images, and pricing, while **Supabase** powers the backend database and authentication system.  

The platform allows users to search and filter cruise options, save their favorites, and manage bookings securely.

## Key Features

- **Live Cruise Data**: Fetches real-time cruise itineraries, pricing, and availability directly from the Widgety API.
- **Ship Profiles**: Detailed ship information including images, deck plans, and onboard amenities.
- **Destination Search**: Filter cruises by destination, departure port, cruise line, or date range.
- **Itinerary Details**: View day-by-day itineraries, including port stops and excursion details.
- **User Accounts & Authentication**: Implemented with **Supabase Auth** for secure sign-up, login, and profile management.
- **Saved Cruises**: Users can bookmark cruises to revisit later, stored in **Supabase**.
- **Media Integration**: High-quality images and videos of ships, destinations, and cabins.
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile for a seamless booking experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For building a fast, SEO-optimized, and scalable frontend application.
- **Supabase**: For database management, authentication, and user data storage.
- **Widgety API**: For retrieving live cruise itineraries, ship details, and associated media.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For modern, responsive, and easily customizable UI components.
- **Vercel**: For deployment, hosting, and global CDN distribution.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was **handling and caching large volumes of API data** from Widgety while ensuring fast load times. To solve this, incremental static regeneration (ISR) in Next.js was combined with **Supabase** storage for persistent data, reducing redundant API calls.  

Integrating **Supabase Auth** into the booking and saving workflow required careful synchronization between Widgety API data and local user data to ensure a seamless experience.

## Outcome

Cruisly delivers a **streamlined cruise discovery and booking experience** with secure user accounts, saved favorites, and real-time cruise information. By combining **Next.js**, **Supabase**, and the **Widgety API**, the platform achieves high performance, reliability, and scalability for the travel booking industry.
