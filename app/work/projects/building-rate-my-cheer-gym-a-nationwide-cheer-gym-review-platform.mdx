## Overview

**Rate My Cheer Gym** is a platform that enables users to discover, rate, and review cheer gyms across the United States. Built with **Next.js** for a fast, SEO-friendly frontend and **Supabase** for backend services, the application combines user-generated reviews with location-based search to help cheerleaders and parents find the best training facilities.

The project’s goal was to create a user-friendly, trustworthy platform that not only collects ratings but also fosters transparency and community engagement in the cheerleading industry.

## Key Features

- **Cheer Gym Directory**: Comprehensive listing of cheer gyms across the USA with detailed profiles including location, photos, and contact information.
- **Ratings & Reviews**: Users can leave ratings, write reviews, and share experiences to help others make informed decisions.
- **Supabase Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login with email/password or social providers, powered by Supabase Auth.
- **Search & Filtering**: Location-based search and filters for finding gyms by state, rating, or specialty.
- **Responsive UI**: Fully optimized for desktop and mobile users, ensuring accessibility on all devices.
- **User Profiles**: Track review history, manage personal details, and customize profile settings.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For building a fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable frontend.
- **Supabase (Database)**: For storing gym data, reviews, and user information in a relational PostgreSQL database.
- **Supabase Auth**: For secure authentication and session management.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For a clean, responsive, and customizable UI design.
- **Cloudflare**: For deployment and hosting with global CDN.

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was designing the database schema in **Supabase** to efficiently handle thousands of gyms and potentially tens of thousands of reviews while keeping queries fast.

Managing authentication with Supabase was straightforward, but ensuring a smooth **user experience** during sign-up, login, and review submission required handling edge cases like duplicate reviews and spam prevention.

Optimizing **SEO for local search** was also a major focus, ensuring each gym profile page ranked well for relevant searches in Google.

## Outcome

The platform has successfully launched and is now helping cheerleaders, athletes, and parents make informed decisions when choosing a gym.

By combining **Next.js** for performance and **Supabase** for seamless database + authentication integration, Rate My Cheer Gym delivers a secure, fast, and easy-to-use experience for the cheerleading community.
