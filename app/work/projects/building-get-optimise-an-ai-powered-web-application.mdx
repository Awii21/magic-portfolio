## Overview

Development of an AI-powered SaaS platform designed for businesses to optimize workflows and decision-making. The application was built using **Next.js with TypeScript** for the frontend, integrated with a **MySQL database** via **Drizzle ORM**, and powered by Python-based Machine Learning scripts for AI-driven insights.  

The platform also features **Stripe integration** for secure subscription management and payment processing, enabling a smooth monetization flow for SaaS customers.  

The goal was to create a **secure and high-performance system** capable of handling complex CRUD operations, authentication flows, payments, and AI-driven automation at scale.

## Key Features

- **TypeScript + Next.js Frontend**: Implemented a strongly-typed, modular architecture for scalable feature development, ensuring better maintainability and fewer runtime errors.
- **CRUD Operations**: Designed and implemented fully functional Create, Read, Update, and Delete workflows for multiple resource types, optimized for both speed and security.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Integrated **Better Auth** to provide a secure, role-based authentication system with session management and OAuth2 support.
- **Payments & Subscriptions**: Implemented **Stripe** for secure payment processing, subscription billing, and automated invoice generation.
- **AI-Driven Backend Processing**: Leveraged Python scripts and Machine Learning models to deliver automated recommendations, data insights, and intelligent content generation.
- **Database Layer**: Used **MySQL** with **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database queries, migrations, and schema management.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js (TypeScript)**: For building a fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly frontend.
- **Better Auth**: For secure authentication and user management.
- **Stripe**: For payments, subscription billing, and financial reporting.
- **MySQL + Drizzle ORM**: For efficient, type-safe database interactions and schema migrations.
- **Python (Flask + FastAPI)**: For AI model integration and backend processing.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was designing a system that could **seamlessly integrate AI capabilities** without compromising performance or user experience. Achieving type-safety across the entire stack with TypeScript and Drizzle greatly reduced errors and improved developer productivity.  

Integrating **Stripe** with the role-based authentication system required careful planning to ensure that subscription statuses synced accurately with user permissions and access levels.  

Another challenge was **maintaining security** while offering flexible customization options. By implementing role-based access control via Better Auth, strict API validation, and secure payment flows, the platform achieved both security and scalability.  

Collaboration between the AI backend team and the frontend developers required a **clear contract-based API design**, which was achieved using FastAPIâ€™s schema-first approach.

## Outcome

The Get Optimise platform now serves as a **highly secure, AI-powered SaaS solution** with built-in payment capabilities. Businesses can automate processes, make data-driven decisions, and manage subscriptions seamlessly.  

The combination of a scalable architecture, type-safe development, integrated payments, and a strong design system has resulted in **faster release cycles**, improved maintainability, and a more cohesive user experience across the application.
