## Overview

GayUnity is a modern gay dating platform designed to create a safe, inclusive, and user-friendly space for the LGBTQ+ community to connect. The platform was developed with **React (Vite)** on the frontend and **Node.js with Express** on the backend, featuring **Stripe** integration for subscription-based features and **PostgreSQL** for secure and efficient data storage.

The focus was on delivering a responsive, real-time user experience with robust authentication, messaging capabilities, and a payment-enabled premium membership system.

## Key Features

- **Responsive React (Vite) Frontend**: Built an optimized, modular UI with a fast-loading, responsive design tailored for both desktop and mobile users.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Implemented secure, instant chat functionality so users can connect seamlessly.
- **Authentication & Security**: Developed a secure login and account verification system to protect user privacy and prevent spam accounts.
- **Premium Memberships**: Integrated **Stripe** for subscription billing, enabling access to premium features such as unlimited messaging and advanced search filters.
- **Profile Customization**: Allowed users to personalize profiles with photos, bios, and interest tags for better matches.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Used PostgreSQL for relational data management, ensuring performance and scalability for large user bases.

## Technologies Used

- **React (Vite)**: For a fast, modular, and highly optimized frontend.
- **Node.js + Express**: For building a secure and scalable backend API.
- **Stripe**: For subscription billing and payment processing.
- **PostgreSQL**: For reliable and efficient relational database management.
- **Socket.io**: For real-time chat and notifications.

## Challenges and Learnings

A major challenge was ensuring **real-time communication** remained performant and stable at scale. Optimizing WebSocket connections and implementing robust error handling were key in delivering a smooth chat experience.  

Integrating **Stripe** with role-based permissions required careful planning so that subscription status directly influenced available features without causing sync issues.  

Additionally, building a dating platform meant placing a strong emphasis on **privacy and safety**, which led to implementing strict content moderation tools and user reporting mechanisms.

## Outcome

GayUnity successfully launched as a **modern, inclusive dating platform**, combining a sleek UI with powerful backend functionality. The integration of real-time messaging, secure authentication, and seamless payment processing has provided users with a reliable and enjoyable platform to connect.  

The project demonstrated the effectiveness of combining **React (Vite)** with **Node.js + Express** for speed and scalability, while **PostgreSQL** and **Stripe** ensured stability and monetization opportunities.
